# Reproducible Named Entity Transliteration (ReproNETs)

ReproNETs is a hub for named entity transliteration models. 
It hosts trained models and provides simple interfaces to make them accesssible. 

The models avaiable:
* [Phonetisaurus](https://github.com/AdolfVonKleist/Phonetisaurus) 
* [Transformer](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762)

The languages we currently support:
* English to Arabic
* English to Chinese
* English to Hebrew
* English to Japanese
* English to Korean
* English to Russian

GUI provides a tool to easily and visually compare outputs across the `Transformer` and the `Phonetisaurus` with different beam sizes. It shows predicted sequence(s) along with the probability of each sequence. 

## API

ReproNETs provide a public API that provides transliteration as a service via simple HTTP request. 

The query parameters are:
* input: Any English word to transliterate. It must be less than or 37 characters.
* language: The target language. It must be either `ara`, `chi`, `heb`, `jpn`, `kor`, or `rus`. 
* beam: The size of beam search. It must be an integer from 1 to 5.
* model: The name of a transliteration model. It must be either `phonetisaurus`, `transformer` or `all`.

### Request

``` bash
curl \
  --request GET   \
  --url 'https://boxkey.me/repronets/api/predict?input=rocky&language=jpn&beam=3&model=all' \
